The Data Science Process is ASK-> GET -> EXPLORE -> MODEL -> REPORT

1. ASK – Describe the problem or question and the proposed data set

1. GET – Have a reproducible GET step to obtain and clean your data that produces a "data warehouse". This data warehouse may be a sqlite3 database or flat files (CSV/TSV)

1. EXPLORE - A full EDA (exploratory data analysis)

1. MODEL - Establish a Null Model and Linear/Logistic Regression for the target variable with error bounds

1. REPORT - Generate a document of findings, conclusions, model, etc
